<p>Welcome to my interactive resume! Use the following commands to get around. There are also a few surprises hidden...</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>open</strong> - Opens external items, such as a pdf copy of my <i>resume</i> or my <i>LinkedIn</i> profile
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>link</strong> - Generates links to external items, if <i>open</i> is blocked
    </li>
</ul>
<p>A few standard linux commands work about as expected, too. Try them out!</p>
